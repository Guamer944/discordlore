        <div class="page" id="chapter1-page" data-page-number="1">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Meet the Mess</h2>
            <p>Fatemeh and Zahra were not your average 10-year-olds. Actually, calling them "average" was generous. These two were accidents in every sense: kinda smart but mostly not, ugly as sin, and totally obsessed with Stray Kids—like, really obsessed. Fatemeh’s heart was locked on Denzel, who, luckily for her, kinda liked her back. Zahra had it bad for Joel, who was not awkward at all—social anxiety literally feared him.</p>
            <p>Their friend group was a massive mess: Darine, Marguerite, Savirose, Nadine, Aiden, Angel, Denzel, Yu Zhi, Charlotte, Jasmine, Enxhi, Malek, Amiyah, Harmeetpal, Joel, Fernando, Anna, Malu, Afrika, Victor. Yeah, a whole parade of chaos.</p>
            <p>Fernando was the third main character and the undisputed best. The smartest, strongest, fastest, and overall superior human to ever walk the earth—or at least their playground. Oh, and he hated Stray Kids with a fiery passion. Fatemeh and Zahra could not comprehend how anyone could hate their beloved group.</p>
            <p>Yu Zhi was, well, something else. She only showered once every two years and smelled like a public bathroom after a three-day music festival. To put it simply: extremely stupid and extremely stinky. Fernando, being a man of refined tastes, despised even being near her.</p>
            <p>Darine was on another level—she’d once kidnapped P. Diddy and, as P. Diddy said himself, “unfortunately” got caught. Darine was also dating Ibrahim, who was MASSIVE—bigger than a whole freaking whale.</p>
            <p>And then there was Harmeetpal, who secretly dated chicken nuggets. Yeah, no one really knew how or why, but that’s a chapter for another day.</p>

            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: The School Day Shenanigans</h2>
            <p>Fatemeh and Zahra were late again. They sprinted through the halls, barely dodging their 3rd-grade teacher, Mrs. Crankypants, who looked like she could turn into a banshee at any moment.</p>
            <p>Denzel was waiting for Fatemeh by their lockers, nervously clutching a note that basically said, “I like you, wanna be my girlfriend?” Fatemeh blushed so hard she almost melted through the floor.</p>
            <p>Joel was across the hall, effortlessly commanding the room’s attention. He was the alpha kid, the king of the playground. No one dared challenge Joel, especially social anxiety, who just hid under desks whenever Joel strutted by.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Fernando was busy dominating the schoolyard. He won every race, aced every test, and had rizz so high it practically glowed. He wasn’t just cool; he was the definition of cool. But his hatred for Stray Kids remained an enigma to all.</p>
            <p>Yu Zhi wandered nearby, trying to solve a math problem but somehow managed to confuse addition with eating snacks. Everyone gave her a wide berth, nose plugs ready.</p>

        <div class="page" id="chapter3-page" data-page-number="3">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: The Birthday Disaster</h2>
            <p>Fatemeh’s birthday party was going to be legendary. She invited everyone except Fernando because he hated Stray Kids and she really wanted him there. The party was full of cake, bad dancing, and Stray Kids blasting on the speakers.</p>
            <p>Denzel tried to impress Fatemeh by juggling fruit, which ended up hitting Harmeetpal’s secret nugget stash. The chicken nuggets retaliated by disappearing mysteriously.</p>
            <p>Joel, being Joel, charmed the whole room. Kids gravitated to him like moths to a flame. He told stories of his confident plans to conquer the world, though no one knew how exactly.</p>
            <p>Yu Zhi tried to blow out the candles but ended up setting her hair on fire. Thankfully, Fernando was nearby to douse the flames with his super-speed reflexes.</p>
            <p>Darine showed up late, claiming she had just escaped P. Diddy’s revenge squad. Nobody believed her, but the massive bruises told a different story.</p>

            <p>Love was in the air, or maybe it was just the weird smell from Yu Zhi. Fatemeh and Denzel were basically inseparable now, holding hands everywhere like a mini power couple.</p>
            <p>Zahra was swooning over Joel, who wasn’t awkward one bit. Joel’s charisma was so strong that even social anxiety bowed down to him.</p>
            <p>Darine was pregnant (courtesy of Danil, who was the sneakiest dude in the crew) and trying to keep it together while still kidnapping celebrities.</p>
            <p>Harmeetpal kept sneaking off to his nugget dates, whispering sweet nothings to the crispy golden delights.</p>
            <p>Fernando kept rolling his eyes at the whole mess but secretly admired Fatemeh’s devotion and wished he could be that focused on something other than hating Stray Kids.</p>

            <p>The gang went on a school trip that turned into a disaster movie.</p>
            <p>Yu Zhi got lost and ended up in a swamp, where she mistook a frog for a new pet.</p>
            <p>Joel saved Fatemeh from falling into a river with one hand, earning her eternal gratitude (and a kiss on the cheek).</p>
            <p>Denzel finally confessed his love properly, and Fatemeh swooned like a soap opera queen.</p>
            <p>Fernando outran a bear. No joke. The bear still remembers the shame.</p>
            <p>Darine got kicked off the trip for smuggling in a bunch of illegal snacks and trying to kidnap the tour guide.</p>
            <p>Harmeetpal’s nuggets were confiscated but he smuggled a few in his backpack for emergency dates.</p>

            <p>The playground turned into a battlefield. Fernando challenged anyone who doubted him to a race. The prize? Ultimate bragging rights and control of the swings.</p>
            <p>Zahra and Fatemeh teamed up to stop Fernando from being too cocky but accidentally caused chaos instead.</p>
            <p>Joel negotiated peace with such smooth talking that even Fernando couldn’t refuse.</p>
            <p>Yu Zhi was voted “most likely to accidentally destroy the playground,” which she took as a compliment.</p>
            <p>Darine was banned from swings forever. No one argued.</p>
            <p>Harmeetpal organized a nugget feast, turning enemies into friends.</p>

            <p>Joel became a professional basketball legend, playing alongside LeBron James for 6.9 years. The highlight? A surprise kiss that shocked the world and made headlines everywhere.</p>
            <p>Fernando became a wildly successful entrepreneur with level 100 rizz, charming investors and dominating the business world. He stayed single, focusing on success and occasionally roasting Stray Kids on Twitter.</p>
            <p>Yu Zhi married Victor and had 96 kids, somehow still managing to only shower every two years (scientists are baffled).</p>
            <p>Harmeetpal was Fernando’s best friend and still secretly dating chicken nuggets, now with more sophisticated dinner dates.</p>

            <p>Fatemeh and Denzel still acted like kids, Zahra and Joel were the power couple everyone envied, and Fernando kept breaking hearts and business records.</p>
            <p>Darine was busy running her own kidnapping agency (mostly for fun), and Yu Zhi somehow remained blissfully stupid.</p>
            <p>Harmeetpal finally came out about his nugget relationship and became an internet sensation.</p>
